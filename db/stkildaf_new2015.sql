(31, 'Michael', 'Joseph', '96465936 / 0448848193', 'mik2sol@yahoo.com.au', 'Yes', 'This is for the image  mailed on September 4 2012. Please find the image on the white CD marked with orange in the name of Michael Joseph and PH. It is the third image sent from Michael Joseph since August 24. I hope you enjoy it. Please excuse any of the wording when it does not sound or appear gentle respectable unaggressive.\nTo win the competition for the 2013 St Kilda Festival Poster this image is pre-eminent. It is more fully encompassing - more preserving and containing the best of St Kilda, than sex and warm weather (ice-cream in a cone) - a product for youth and children for example. On the question of humility and originality, it is not less humble or less original than the posters containing the sea-gull or the ice-cream in a cone.\nIn the past I helped create and sold many hand made statues, picture paintings, portraits and well crafted images on the St Kilda Esplanade. I have over the years been closely connected to the life of St Kilda. Without saying too much, for a long time now I have been a vital spirit in the life blood of St Kilda. I think you will find this poster image more valuable than a gold mine, if I must say so myself. Although it may be extraordinary and different it would be incredibly attractive. But of course it will be up to the judges to decide.\nOn the level, and on the whole although it may have a slightly spooky eerie sense about it, and the subliminal effects are subtle, the feeling for it is predominately weird and wonderful - quite brilliant. Unless something overly simple is wanted, something that would be called drab after all that has gone before, or you are only trying to attract children or naive adults, on a first look this image may seem too much or complicated. But most people will recognize that it isn''t. After a first look a glimpse or a glance will reveal it''s simplicity. And it would be more attractive than what is assumed to be more simple. We don''t necessarily and always have to make little things big and vice versa. People today are advanced, evolved and mentally developed. Without losing any of the attributes sex, fine warm weather, family, youth and children that the ice-cream poster may have given for example this poster image will give them more.\nAside from sex, family, love, children and the beach, money, health and other essentials - good food, art, the theatre, and lunar Park have always been at the heart of St Kilda.\nNothing attracts people more than people and the hint of sex or sexual implication conservatively hidden under the very noses of children and childlike adults. People are important whether or not we are talking about the suburb or city of St Kilda and it''s nature or landscape. St Kilda is renowned for being a romantic and sexual hotspot. I think you''ll agree that it is mainly people who bring it to life. This is how it is now and especially during the time of the Festival. More attention is now more usually drawn to the person rather than their surroundings especially during festival time. And this poster would do it all. \nPeople don''t need another poster that predominately looks like a cartoon. It is strongly believed that you needn''t be more concerned with what attracts children or families, adults and adults who think like children than what this poster would have to offer. It is a fallacy to believe that people are attracted to or inspired only by something that looks generally and predominately like a cartoon. These days one of the most attractive things for so-called modern folk is called "facebook". Therefore this image is intrinsically relevant - essential to today''s family and youth. It is a modern expression and reflexion of a modern society that will attract all classes, races and cultures.\nFor the St Kilda Festival Poster competition this image is not about ego. Currently there is an awareness and desire for a shift in schools from concentration on the subject to concentration on the person (the human being). With this and the belief or true knowledge of "The Secret" law of attraction http://www.thesecret.tv/ this image would prove to be hugely inspiring. Many people have heard of "the Secret" but have not been able to apply it to their daily lives because they are skeptical, they don''t know, or they forget and they lose consciousness. This will inform, remind them and resolve any doubts. St Kilda is a Stage just like "All the world is a stage". You know, it is a world within a world and a unique world of it''s own. It probably has been since Dame Nellie Melba. It deserves something special.\nActing by the plum (moral rectitude) the white mask symbolises coconut cream pies like a pie in one''s face. This also suggests and brings Australian culture and an Australian icon to the fore. By virtue of the colour, although it is done in a subtle, maybe not so subtle but modest fashion, the mask also represents - directs thoughts/people to boat sails, sea-gulls and doves. It also subliminally symbolises and directs people to ice-cream, summer clouds, romance, the sun, hence the beach, make up, beauty, sex, skin care and sun protection. In it there is reinforcement of a caution for men to be gentle and careful around females. It is well connected with the theatre, music, all of St Kilda''s shops, and worlds of other St Kilda attractions including Luna Park. \nIt is packed and loaded with magnetism while at the same time maintaining simplicity. Also it will attract and inspire those who have an interest in businesses such as facebook etc. Much of what it suggests is subliminal yet practical for the Melbournian and Victorian climate of people "being on the move". It is certainly a very powerful psychological image, one which will have a major impact, however nice and good. There is no question that it will work, no question of how it will work, it just will. The mind registers what it recognises and is drawn towards it.\nIt is different but truly refreshing, just like there is nothing more refreshing than a day at the beach. Yet it doesn''t have to look like someone at the beach. This is simply because St Kilda has more to offer. And in this image if it isn''t too much and making it obvious the words St Kilda could be written across the shirt in the area of the solar plexus. The first letter ''S'' could be underlined in all the words. This could be used for any additional promotional material that you''d like. The font of the words can be changed, expanded or highlighted and the bow tie can also be highlighted for black and white print. People don''t need the stuff that they are used to seeing. Art, attraction, advertising, promotion etc. is not about that.  \nAfter seeing the stuff that they are used to seeing so much of people will be turned off if they get more of the same. It will not stir the appetite, inspire, attract or leave any room for curiosity and romance. These are essential for the promotion of the 2013 St Kilda Festival. The posters that have previously been used never attracted me and they didn''t attract scores of other people either. But they were not merely supposed to be signs. I am sure they were not meant to leave out any portion of the population, but they did. And it is precisely because of them that this would be most suitable for the winning of this competition. It is my deepest belief that this potential poster would truly be the best and most outstanding representation for the 2013 St Kilda Festival. \nIt''s time for something different, truly new, something that will attract new crowds while providing a sense of awe. It will also be fitting for the generation that remembers and rises above the times of the last major war. The fallout side-effects are still being felt and will continue to be felt for many years to come. Any campaign with this poster will bring relief to these side-effects and the crowds to St kilda will be so much bigger that you may even find big traffic jams ensue. I hope you can be ready for that too.\nComfort can be taken in the fact that this poster image will not be so revolutionary that it could turn people away. This will not happen. In fact it will not be revolutionary, but rather refreshing. Those already in the habit of going to the Festival will keep going. Those who are not, may be tantalised but they will certainly be attracted. They will come to the festival and they will be more closely drawn to St kilda.\nYou know, this idea and the idea of a person being in the picture for a St Kilda Festival poster is protected by copyright laws and is Australian Intellectual property. \nWith respect, I would like to say just one more thing, and while I''m at it I hope you can excuse the length of this note. In case you or anyone concerned with this isn''t aware of it, I would like to enlighten you about something. The people who did the poster of the ice cream actually meant it subliminally to represent the back-side of a full and shapely woman with her torso out of sight. So she is actually like a dancer with her front side leaning and bent forward out of sight. This is so that all that is directly revealed is her backside. The cone was the back of her naked legs tightly held together with or without special netted stockings and without a vertical line in the centre. The top where the ice-cream is supposed to be was actually her buttocks dressed or undressed to a certain point and the rest is left to the imagination. \nThere were many slightly different versions of the cream especially around the top in order to avoid being obvious perhaps making it more obvious. Although this poster of the ice-cream is harmless enough this was the true intention and idea behind it. It is subliminal and it is known to me by first hand experience for a fact. In case you were not aware of it already I hope you did not mind me revealing it to you. Please do not take this introductory note as a sign of any arrogance or disrespect. Thank you.\n \n \n', '2012-09-04 21:24:40'),

The reason being is that i feel the picture represents the colours and life that is embraced every day i am in St.Kilda and especially in the St Kilda Music Festival. The way that i have set up the photo is that the butterfly in her hand represents the Festivan and St Kilda in the way that when I go to work in St Kilda i feel a release of freedom. One that a butterfly would have as such. The face paint represents fun and a broad range of cultural differences coming as one to have a really great time and chill out. And finally the reason why i got her to pose as such is because she seems facsinated with the butterfly that she has in her hand as if she wants to play. I am excited as to see how far my photo goes. xx Britney', '2012-09-06 06:25:52'),

(42, 'Michael ', 'Joseph', '96465936', 'mik2sol@yahoo.com.au', 'Yes', 'To whom it may concern,\n \nThis is an explanation for the attached image to win the competition for the 2013 St Kilda Festival Poster. It is pre-eminent. It is more fully encompassing - preserving and containing the best of St Kilda, than sex and warm weather (ice-cream in a cone) - a product for youth and children for example. On the question of humility and originality, it is not less humble or less original than the posters containing the sea-gull or the ice-cream in a cone.\nIn the past I helped create and sold many hand made statues, picture paintings, portraits and well crafted images on the St Kilda Esplanade. I have over the years been closely connected to the life of St Kilda. Without saying too much, for a long time now I have been a vital spirit in the life blood of St Kilda. I think you will find this poster image more valuable than a gold mine, if I must say so myself. Although it may be extraordinary and different it would be incredibly attractive. But of course it will be up to the judges to decide.\nOn the level, and on the whole although it may have a slightly spooky eerie sense about it, and the subliminal effects are subtle, the feeling for it is predominately weird and wonderful - quite brilliant. Unless something overly simple is wanted, something that would be called drab after all that has gone before, or you are only trying to attract children or naive adults, on a first look this image may seem too much or complicated. But most people will recognize that it isn''t. After a first look a glimpse or a glance will reveal it''s simplicity. And it would be more attractive than what is assumed to be more simple. We don''t necessarily and always have to make little things big and vice versa. People today are advanced, evolved and mentally developed. Without losing any of the attributes sex, fine warm weather, family, youth and children that the ice-cream poster may have given for example this poster image will give them more.\nAside from sex, family, love, children and the beach, money, health and other essentials - good food, art, the theatre, and lunar Park have always been at the heart of St Kilda.\nNothing attracts people more than people and the hint of sex or sexual implication conservatively hidden under the very noses of children and childlike adults. People are important whether or not we are talking about the suburb or city of St Kilda and it''s nature or landscape. St Kilda is renowned for being a romantic and sexual hotspot. I think you''ll agree that it is mainly people who bring it to life. This is how it is now. More attention is now more usually drawn to the person rather than their surroundings. And this poster would do it all. \nPeople don''t need another poster that pedominately looks like a cartoon. It is strongly believed that you needn''t be more concerned with what attracts children or families, adults and adults who think like children than what this poster would have to offer. It is a fallacy to believe that people are attracted to or inspired only by something that looks generally and predominately like a cartoon. These days one of the most attractive things for so-called modern folk is called "facebook". Therefore this image is intrinsically relevant - essential to today''s family and youth. It is a modern expression and reflexion of a modern society that will attract all classes, races and cultures.\nFor the St Kilda Festival Poster competition this image is not about ego. Currently there is an awareness and desire for a shift in schools from concentration on the subject to concentration on the person (the human being). With this and the belief or true knowledge of "The Secret" law of attraction http://www.thesecret.tv/ this image would prove to be hugely inspiring. Many people have heard of "the Secret" but have not been able to apply it to their daily lives because they are skeptical, they don''t know, or they forget and they lose consciousness. This will inform, remind them and resolve any doubts. St Kilda is a Stage just like "All the world is a stage". You know, it is a world within a world and a unique world of it''s own. It probably has been since Dame Nellie Melba. It deserves something special.\n \nActing by the plum (moral rectitude) the white mask symbolises coconut cream pies like a pie in one''s face. This also suggests and brings Australian culture and an Australian icon to the fore. By virtue of the colour, although it is done in a subtle, maybe not so subtle but modest fashion, the mask also represents - directs thoughts/people to boat sails, sea-gulls and white doves. It also subliminally symbolises and directs people to ice-cream, summer clouds, romance, the sun, hence the beach, make up, beauty, sex, skin care and sun protection. In it there is reinforcement of a caution for men to be gentle and careful around women. It is well connected with the theatre, music, all of St Kilda''s shops, and worlds of other St Kilda attractions including Luna Park. \nIt is packed and loaded with magnetism while at the same time maintaining simplicity. Also it will attract and inspire those who have an interest in businesses such as facebook etc. Much of what it suggests is subliminal yet practical for the Melbournian and Victorian climate of people "being on the move". It is certainly a very powerful psychological image, one which will have a major impact, however nice and good. There is no question that it will work, no question of how it will work, it just will. The mind registers what it recognises and is drawn towards it.\nIt is different but truly refreshing, just like there is nothing more refreshing than a day at the beach. Yet it doesn''t have to look like someone at the beach. This is simply because St Kilda has more to offer. And in this image if it isn''t too much and making it obvious the words St Kilda could be written across the shirt in the area of the solar plexus. The first letter ''S'' could be underlined in all the words. This could be used for any additional promotional material that you''d like. The font of the words can be changed, expanded or highlighted and the bow tie can also be highlighted for black and white print. People don''t need the stuff that they are used to seeing. Art, attraction, advertising, promotion etc. is not about that.  \nAfter seeing the stuff that they are used to seeing so much of people will be turned off if they get more of the same. It will not stir the appetite, inspire, attract or leave any room for curiosity and romance. These are essential for the promotion of the 2013 St Kilda Festival. The posters that have previously been used never attracted me and they didn''t attract scores of other people either. But they were not merely supposed to be signs. I am sure they were not meant to leave out any portion of the population, but they did. And it is precisely because of them that this would be most suitable for the winning of this competition. It is my deepest belief that this potential poster would truly be the best and most outstanding representation for the 2013 St Kilda Festival. \nIt''s time for something different, truly new, something that will attract new crowds while providing a sense of awe. It will also be fitting for the generation that remembers and rises above the times of the last major war. The fallout side-effects are still being felt and will continue to be felt for many years to come. Any campaign with this poster will bring relief to these side-effects and the crowds to St kilda will be so much bigger that you may even find big traffic jams ensue. I hope you can be ready for that too.\nComfort can be taken in the fact that this poster image will not be so revolutionary that it could turn people away. This will not happen. In fact it will not be revolutionary, but rather refreshing. Those already in the habit of going to the Festival will keep going. Those who are not, may be tantalised but they will certainly be attracted. They will come to the festival and they will be more closely drawn to St kilda.\nYou know, this idea and the idea of a person being in the picture for a St Kilda Festival poster is protected by copyright laws and is Australian Intellectual property. \nWith respect, I would like to say just one more thing, and while I''m at it I hope you can excuse the length of this note. In case you or anyone concerned with this isn''t aware of it, I would like to enlighten you about something.

We have been using coconut products since way back when and know that it is the most sustainable and versatile natural food. We had been sharing our passion for all things coconut with our friends so it just made sense to then share it with as many people as we could. Experience has shown that it has always been hard to find beautiful organic raw foods at festivals.\n\nSo why St Kilda Festival?\n\nSt Kilda Festival pride themselves on providing not only a quality music line-up but also offering some of the best festival food around. Our menu and methods are unique in the coconut traveling circus. We also want to be extremely selective in the festivals we choose to apply for.  We want what we have to offer to mirror the festival quality and energy.\n\nBeing the cocoNUTS that we are we couldn’t just leave the coconut alone. After a lot of self-experimentation we have come up with what we believe are the most unique coconut superfood combinations available anywhere in Australia if not the world. The first one we called the MAGIC COCONUT because it is simply magic. With the second we ran with magic and went bananas with the MONKEY MAGIC.  We couldn’t just leave it there so created our own custom made coconut tapping machine. We just love being uniquely nuts. Our view is it’s not just the food but how it’s prepared. We offer fine dining and show!! People just love watching us take the tops off coconuts with years highly honed knife skills that all our crew are able to do.\n\nSo what is it that makes The Young Green Coconut so special?\n\nWe not only offer the amazing life giving properties of coconut juice. After drinking the juice the festival goer returns for us to open a coconut so that they can eat the young coconut jelly flesh. We are also the only coconut vendor to add our unique blend of superfoods and only organic seasonal fresh fruit.\n\nOur Menu:\nTHE PURIST - fresh coconut tapped on demand and once drunk opened up so the young coconut jelly can be enjoyed. $7.00\n\nTHE MAGIC COCONUT - the young jelly flesh mixed with organic coconut sugar, organic cinnamon, organic slithered almonds, organic Goji berries, organic barberries, organic marberries, organic roasted buckwheat, organic pumpkin seeds and organic sunflower seeds. $10.00\n\nTHE MONKEY MAGIC - like the magic coconut only we add banana - the young jelly flesh mixed with organic banana organic coconut sugar, organic cinnamon, organic slithered almonds, organic Goji berries, organic barberries, organic marberries, organic roasted buckwheat, organic pumpkin seeds and organic sunflower seeds. $10.00\n\nCOCO LUX DELUXE - organic tropical seasonal fresh fruit mixed with the young jelly flesh, organic coconut sugar, organic cinnamon, organic almonds, roasted buckwheat, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds. $17.00\n\nHOT COCO LOCO BREW - coconut milk, organic maca powder, organic fresh spices and Bonsoy (the best soy milk) - made fresh and from scratch, steeped slowly and lovingly. $5.00\n\n\n', 'Yes', '2012-08-17 14:47:10'),

The upper Esplanade roadway needed to be widened to accommodate the new tram tracks. As part of the embankment works, provision was made for ten shops with arched ceilings facing onto the lower Esplanade (now Jacka Boulevard) to be built into the supporting wall, as well as a stairway of bluestone steps. When complete, the cable tramway which ran from Acland Street to St Kilda Station was deemed a great success, as noted in the St Kilda Council Annual Report 1891: The Esplanade Cable Tramway is regarded as perhaps the most satisfactory, and complete in the world, and is greatly appreciated by the travelling public, in and around the metropolis. Bricked up in the 1970s when road widening took place, the vaults rarely open to the public.

Emmy loves to write music that makes people happy.  She is currently and has played past gigs around Melbourne including local venues such as Veludo''s Elwood Lounge etc whilst preparing for her full band 8-date East Coast Tour in November (see her website for details).  What''s next?  Second single release and tour in February/March 2012 followed by an international tour of Asia in late 2012.  Exciting!Produced by Aria nominated producer Jimi Maroudas (Eskimo Joe Birdie Blackman) & Benjamin McCarthy (Pete Murray Kate Miller-Heidke) the album is of high quality - songwriting and production.

We use special spice rubs to act as a marinade before cooking. We mop the meat during the cooking process with flavoured sauces to add more flavour and to retain and enhance the natural moistness of the meat.

A familiar yet different four piece rock n roll band it is happy to fly in many musical directions from rock n roll to rockabilly to folk and blues and back again. The Parrot is a unique bird in todays musical landscape. All its members sing and are seasoned musicians who have played for years and have the scars to prove it. The versatility of the band has enabled it to draw a small but dedicated following that slowly grows with each performance.Live work is what this band is all about at and their blend of melodies harmonies and a tight rhythm section have enabled them to play regularly with very good reviews from their audiences. Some liken their cameraderie and presence on stage with Crowded House. As one drunken pundit put it recently at the Palace " real music...nobody plays that shit anymore. F!@king grouse"! A more credible and indeed sober review came from Mr Jeff Consi an in demand US session drummer touring with Extreme''s Nuno Bettencourt who says that "you got some really good tunes there". Jeff liked it so much he agreed to play on the new album! GREEN PARROT has played all over Melbourne and started playing interstate recently. This band is on the up and the strong single One Man WomanThe biggest gig yet was at Revolver but they have also played at: The Palace Camberwell Eltham Hotel Hardimans at Kensington Ruby''s Belgrave The Brunswick Hotel and the Empress among others. The bands  favourite local venue is the Elwood Lounge. It plays here regularly with great crowd support and it is considered among the the band to be the "home game" venue....The single One Man Woman was recently released and is available through iTunes Amazon and a host of other digital avenues. It has so far sold in Australia Canada USA and Germany.The band is currently recording a new album of ten tracks which is scheduled for release in Nov/Dec 2011!The line up:Sturgis Dan - Vocals Bass PianoSi McSweeny - Vocals GuitarAx Cat - Guitars vocalsD Macca - Drums vocals ~What are your band\\''s website, facebook, twittter, blog etc addresses - please add all you have so we can help promote you~www.greenparrotmusic.comwww.facebook.com/greenparrotmusic~Would you like the chance to play The Push stage in 2012?~No~Fee Exempt~No~', 100964),

Currently they are designed & made here in Melbourne.  The trucker hats are individually embellished & hand crafted.My stall proved to be very popular last year even though I was placed right next to the paddle tennis & toilets (opposite the Stokehouse down at the bottom).I wish to place a priority stall area (up at the top) since I have been a stall holder for a number of years now & am a prompt payer & easy client to deal with.  Last year I paid $450 for a stall which hardly attracted any crowd.  I know the importance in the stall placement as I had a stall a few years before this and my sales were significantly better & the crowd mass was much greater which provided for greater exposure.If you could please place a priority request to be up on top where all the crowds are it would be greatly appreciated & would definitely make up for the disappointment I incurred in February this year.Kind RegardsBy TripodAlexandra Tripodis0403384870~Have you had a stall at Yalukit Willam Ngargee or St Kilda Festival before?~Yes~', 0),

Donnie (The Ramblers Merri Creek Pickers) was added on drums Nat Vigo on bass Sam Hall on guitar and back-up vocals. Owen left the band temporarily to focus on his own project but since the release of the ‘Ten Cent Pistols EP’ has rejoined the band on Piano and Organ duties. They recorded their debut EP at the beginning of 2011 (with Tom Iansek of Big Scary) and launched it to a packed crowd at The Workers Club in June. The self-titled EP has since been getting rave reviews being described as “sensational” and “terrific”. One reviewer said that “Ten Cent Pistols have a sound that makes you wanna grow your hair long get ripped and do the helicopter” Buzz Magazine said that the opening track ‘Come Along With Me’ is “one of the best damn tracks you are likely to hear this year” and one reviewer went so far to say that the EP is “a reminder of Oasis back in their glory days”. Nonetheless Ten Cent Pistols are currently bringing their “blend of classic blues rock with a tinge of psychedelia” to bars around Melbourne with a national tour currently in the works to promote their new single that comes out later this year and another EP already in the works.

The band had been slowly growing in popularity since their formation back in 2008 using the music sharing website: Jango as their predominant platform for online distribution with over 700 fans from all over the world; from Canada to Switzerland and even Turkey. Lead singer Brandon Davey lead guitarist Mark Dodson and Bassist Ivan Blacket had already started jamming together when they studying music at the Bellarine Secondary College so it only seemed natural to take these jam sessions to the public and with the incorporation of the drum stylings of Daniel McKoy Mischievous Thom was set onto the world.Even when Mischievous Thom was in its infancy; it had already claimed second place and first place at many local band competitions only to be superseded by earning the prestigious “Best Street Musician” prize at the Apollo Bay Music Festival 3 years in a row. The band has described its genre of music as alternative soft rock drawing inspiration from bands such as Radiohead Nirvana and Red Hot Chilli Peppers. With such fantastic muses at their fingertips it’s no wonder that Mischievous Thom has already recorded and released a full length album with 15 songs titled “Kindness in Red” that draws similarities with REM Modest Mouse and Coldplay. Mischievous Thom can also be found busking on the streets of Melbourne and Geelong; sharing their sound with the general public as well as performing in venues such as the Bended Elbow in Geelong and the Noise Bar in Fitzroy. “Excited about our new sound and eager to discover where music will take us” Mischievous Thom went on a short tour around various parts of Victoria in the summer of last year and are now back writing new songs with plans for recording new album later this year hopefully to be released early in 2012.~What are your band\\''s website, facebook, twittter, blog etc addresses - please add all you have so we can help promote you~~Would you like the chance to play The Push stage in 2012?~No~Fee Exempt~No~', 0),

Incorporating toe tapping grooves heart-wrenching stick throws and blisteringly fast hand speed the drumline can perform either staticly on a stage or moving through a crowd and popping up to quickly create hotspots of activity and keep and audience captivate. Using a stage we can bring in rigs of instruments and develop complex floor movements and formations while moving through the crowd we can get the audience involved and even get them to have a play!The drumline are unlike any other group in australia combining the amazing skills required for precision drumming with the showmanship that only performers as experienced as ours can bring to the table.For this event we would look at starting the show with a snare drum solo on the stage incorporating visuals and speed before having the rest of the drumline march through the crowd playing a groove to get everyone dancing! We can give member of the audience a stick or two to have a bash along on a cowbell to get them involved before continuing on to the stage. We would then play a 30min or so show that will feature all the different sections of the drumline incorporate extensive visual and movements and get the audience involved with some call and answer type interaction.If a longer show is needed we can incorporate Japanese Taiko Drums and African percussion to add greater colour and depth to the show and keep the audience entertained.One of the keys of our performance is that we are highly adaptable. We can create an entire show ourselves or work closely with the desires of the event organisers to achieve their goal. ~Would you like to be considered for Live N Local, Festival Sunday, or both?~Both Live N Local and Festival Sunday~List two referees and their phone numbers - referees must be able to vouch for quality and standards of similar events you have previously held (Not required if your event has previously been held at St Kilda Festival)~Mike Minear - Head of Marketing OTEK Australia/The Handling House AustraliaMike Minear <MMinear@otek.com.au>Nate Flagrant - Artist Manager (incl.

Takoyaki consists of diced seafood (choice of octopus or prawn) & finely-diced cabbage in a savoury batter shaped into balls & drizzled with sauces & garnished with seaweed flakes & dried bonito shavings (smoky in flavour). Taiyaki is a sweet cake shaped like a fish (means ''good fortune'') with a sweet filling (red bean chocolate or custard). Our food stall is registered with the Hobsons Bay City Council. We have so far participated at the Mooncake Festival 2011 & Flavours of Melbourne 2011 both were held at the Queen Victoria Market & the Box Hill Moon Festival 2011. The food is made freshly & quickly in front of the customer & served hot. Our food is unique & visually-appealing. The cooking process is also visually-appealing – customers would see batter being poured into moulds the fresh ingredients being added & the food is turned or pressed into shape & cooked. I believe our stall would add to the festivities of the St Kilda Festival & also the St Kilda Festival is a fantastic event to be a part of being beside the beach in summer & hosting many great music events!Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any queries or would like photos of the foods. Hope to hear from you soon regarding our expression of interest. Thank you.Yours faithfullyJennifer She~Have you had a stall at Yalukit Willam Ngargee or St Kilda Festival before?~No~', 0),
